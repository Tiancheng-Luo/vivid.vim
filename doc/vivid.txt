1. What is Vivid?					*vivid-what-is*

Vivid is a Vim plugin manager built to be minimal, fast and efficient. Vivid
is designed to allow Vim users to fine tune exactly when their plugins are
loaded into Vim. The user is encouraged to use the tools provided by Vivid to
define custom rules for managing their plugins, whilst keeping the process as
simple as possible.

Designed to be extensible, additional plugins can be added to change the
default behaviour of Vivid, or add additional features and tools (WIP).

Vivid can be integrated into other plugins, through the "Vivid Layer
Framework" (WIP). This allows the creation of more powerful and faster
plugins, with much simpler implementation. The VLF essentially allows plugins
to manage other plugins, independent of what plugin manager the user chose to
use. This is possible with very little overhead because of its sheer speed,
and tiny size.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements						*vivid-requirements*

* Vim 8.0.0050 or greater, and compiled with the `+packages` feature.
* Git v1.9 or higher (check using `:!git --version`).
